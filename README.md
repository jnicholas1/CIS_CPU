CPU Project
-----------

Build a CPU of some sort in Logisim.
It should be programmable, but the program does not need to be in RAM (it could be in a separate ROM).
Prove it by implementing some program.
For example:

	Mad-libs
	Fibonacci or hailstone sequence

Work in pairs.
Split work up into separate circuits.

Steps
-----
0. Set up repositories.
1. Decide on an instruction set, and document it.
2. Implement an instruction decoder.
2. Split up into separate components (i.e., the decoder, the ALU, bus unit, program control), and implement.
3. Test with a program.
